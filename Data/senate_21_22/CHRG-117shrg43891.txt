                        [Questions #168 to #472]

                  Submitted to Hon. Antony J. Blinken

                       by Senator James E. Risch

          Secretary-Designate Blinken's Reformatted Questions 
               and Responses [continued from Part I] \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The first set of responses were considered unacceptable [see 
the footnote on page 281 in Part I for a more detailed explanation]. 
The State Department offered to reformat what the Transition Team had 
sent into the numbering system used in the as-submitted Risch QFRs. 
These responses were not substantively different from what the 
Transition Team had sent. This also included the questions that had 
been omitted from the first response document.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================================================================


    [Printer's note: The questions and responses that follow 
are copies of the original material received by the committee. 
Throughout, there are a few blank pages, as well as consecutive 
short pages with very little text. These pages appeared in the 
original documents received from the Department of State and 
are the result of typing errors. They are not an indication of 
an incomplete response.]

                         Responses to Questions

                 Resubmitted to Hon. Antony J. Blinken

                     by Senator James E. Risch \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Many of the responses we received in the initial responses 
(Secretary-Designate Blinken's responses in the reformatted version) 
were unresponsive to the questions asked, so we re-submitted that list 
of unresponsive answers to State. The attached are their responses to 
that list of questions only (not a full list of responses).--Senator 
Risch's staff.
